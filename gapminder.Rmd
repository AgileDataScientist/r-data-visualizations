#This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within #the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

#Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your #cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

# This code is run one time to install packages and obtain the data from socviz

```{r}
install.packages("plotly")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages(socviz)
```


```{r}
# load libraries
library(ggplot2)

# load the data
library(gapminder)
gapminder
```



```{r}
# read data and define x, y variables
p <- ggplot2::ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))

# build scatterplot
p + geom_point()


```

```{r}
# adds standard error and line to scatterplot
```


```{r}
p + geom_smooth()
```


From the original definition of the data to plot of gapminder, and the x-y variables of gdpPercap and lifeExp, respectively, a scatterplot is created with standard error and line using a generalized additive model (gam).0

```{r}
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="gam")
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm")
```
The original plot using a linear model as the method and the x-axis is log base 10 scaled.

```{r}
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm") + scale_x_log10()
```
Nicer tick marks and the x-axis scale can be labelled in dollars. The scales library can be loaded with "library(scales)" or within the scale_x_log10() functions with the "scales::dollar".
```{r}
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="gam") + scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
